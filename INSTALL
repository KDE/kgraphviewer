Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   This package uses the Scons/bksys build system.
   http://freehackers.org/~tnagy/bksys.html


  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     You can also use `./configure debug=full' in order to build a debug
     version. That can be great to be able to send usefull bug reports to
     the author.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. If you have not write permission to the  KDE installation
     directory, you should become root before.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.
