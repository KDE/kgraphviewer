   working KDE Frameworks development environment. See the following URL if it is not
   the case:

   file.

     package.

  3. Move to the src subdirectory:
     cd src

  4. Type `make' to build the package.
 
  5. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. If you have not write permission to the  KDE installation
     directory, you should become root before.
