I have created a dot graphs (Graphviz package, see http://www.graphviz.org/)
for KDE. I used, in this program, code from the profiling tool kcachegrind
 (http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi/KcacheGrindIndex).
For printing, I reused code from the KDE project koffice, namely Kexi, the
database editor.

The tool is not finished but already usable for not huge graphs (< 1000 nodes).
Here are its currently implemented features:
- clusters handling
- zooming
- loading of several graphs in tabs;
- saving of the recent files list;
- manual reload of files;
- display of a bird-eye view of the graph;
- moving of the graph by dragging;
- simple graph printing with preview (no resizing nor cutting in pages);
- closing of the tabs;
- loading of nearly all graphviz example graphs;
- nodes and edges colors and all node shapes are supported

Kgraphviewer is using the boost/spirit library for graphs parsing. To avoid
external dependencies, these Boost parts have been integrated in Kgraphviewer.

See TODO in the distribution for planned features.

Kgraphviewer is currently only available as source from its subversion
repository. See https://gna.org/svn/?group=kgraphviewer for instructions.

As usual, comments, bug reports and any help are very welcome !

Please report bugs or install problems directly on the kgraphviewer homepage
and not as comments here. Thanks.
