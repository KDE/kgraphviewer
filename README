KGraphViewer is a tool to display graphviz .dot graphs. 

It is more generally a KPart able to display any graph data that graphviz can 
handle. This part is commanded through the signals/slots mechanism. It is used
in an experimental dot graphs editor called kgrapheditor released with in this
package.

I used, in this program, code from the profiling tool kcachegrind
 (http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi/KcacheGrindIndex).
For printing, I reused code from the KDE project koffice, namely Kexi, the
database editor.

The currently implemented features are:
- graphviz 2.12 xdot format supported
- zooming
- loading of several graphs in tabs;
- saving of the recent files list;
- manual reload of files;
- display of a bird-eye view of the graph;
- moving of the graph by dragging;
- graph printing with preview;
- loading of nearly all graphviz example graphs;

Kgraphviewer is using the boost/spirit library for graphs parsing.

See TODO in the distribution for planned features.

Kgraphviewer is available as source from the KDE repository.
