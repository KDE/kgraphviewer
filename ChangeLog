2006/07/02
  * fixed a xdot parsing bug
  * fixed a crash condition
  * better handling of parse errors: shows a dialog 

2006/05/27
  * removed a bug appearing with graphviz 2.8

2006/05/26
  * addad in the menu bar the entries from contextual menu and reported this 
    change in documentation
  * added the possibility to disable the bird-eye view (menu, context menu, 
    accel, toolbar) and reported this change in documentation
  * check for memory leaks

2006/05/25
  * added a font cache to optimize a little bit

2006/05/24
  * changes in config dialog now change the status of Apply button
  * make appear the bird-eye view even if it was not initialy appearent when 
    zooming
  * optimizations to be able to load and manipulate larger graphs (200+ linear 
    graph OK)

2006/05/23
  * documentation

2006/05/18
  * corrected placing of window position indicator (red line) in bird eye view 
    when zooming
  * add tooltips and whatsthese everywhere
  * corrected tooltips placement
  * added French translation

2006/05/17
  * corrected drawing errors appearing when dragging after a zoom by updating
    Qt to 3.3.6

2006/05/16
  * all graphviz example graphs are perfectly drawn
  * corrected drawing of parallel edges
  * corrected edges geometry definition (tips appear at wrong places)
  * allow opening of multiple files at the same time

2006/05/15
  * corrected loading of edges bounds labels
  * correct handling of record shaped nodes (see graphviz examples, compare with 
    doted results)
  * corrected handling of fonts (see graphviz examples, compare with 
    doted results)
  * corrected drawing of some undirected graphs in graphviz examples (compare with 
    doted results)
  * added support for main graph label

2006/05/14
  * corrected drawing of clusters (compared with doted results)
  * hack to not freeze with huge graphs. Stop loading after N vertices or edges
    (N currently set to 1000)

2006/05/13
  * maked the window position indicator to be still visible even when zooming a 
    lot (min size or big bold point)

2006/05/12
  * added hard-coded min and max zoom factors
  * scrolling with mouse wheel
  * make minimum canvas size to window size
  * reduce canvas size to graph size when its view becomes larger than itself

2006/05/07
  * better integration of printing (splitting in pages, etc.)
  * change reload icon to a "recycling" icon

2006/05/07
  * printing on multiple pages or fited to one page
  * applying the scaling factor to lines width (since more time but not logged)

2006/05/05
  * added print preview and setup (code reused from the koffice tool kexi)

2006/04/15
  * change mouse pointer to grabbing hand when scrolling

2006/04/13
  * Support for Graphviz 2.8

2006/04/12
  * Bug corrected: crash when closing last tab ;
  * First implementation of support for the URL attribute: the focus follows the
    mouse and clicking on it opens the default browse with the URL (only fully
    qualified URLs are supported for now, not relative paths to files) ;
  * Bug correction: the label is now drawn over the image if any ;

2006/04/11
  * added support for a new dot language attribut: shapefile (node defined by
    an image)
  
2006/04/08
  * session management (reload of previously opened files)
  * context menu to use other layouting algorithms (twopi, fdp, etc.)
  * added a toolbar entry to choose layouting program

2006/03/31
  * automatic reloading (with user confirmation or not) of (externaly)  
    modified files ;

2006/03/30
  * open new instances as new tabs in the old one (should be configurable)

2006/03/29
  * menus and toolbars reorganisation
  * empty file names no more stored in recent files list
  * loading of parallel edges
  * automaticaly choose dot for directed graphs and neato for undirected
  * handling of comments in dot files

2006/03/22
  * important changes. A lot of graphs are now perfectly diplayed.
  * UTF-8 chars in labels now correctly handled.
  
2005/05/20
  * first step towards huge graphs loading. 800 (configurable in code)
    nodes are displayed at max. A lot of work remains on this subject.

2005/05/11
  * add support to all nodes shapes ;
  * correct fill color handling ;
  * parsing without errors of all (?) valid dot files ;
  * added boost/spirit (from boost 1.32) and helpers with appropriate 
    copyright and licensing information in the project to avoid external 
    dependencies

2005/05/07
  * nearly all dot examples load, some of them perfectly (remains 1 
    encoding problem, 1 infinite loop and one graph not handled by dot)

2005/04/28
  * using Boost/Spirit parser generator for parsing dot output
  * handling of fonts in labels
