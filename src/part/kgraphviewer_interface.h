/**
 * KGraphViewerInterface is an interface implemented by KGraphViewer to
 * allow developers access to the KGraphViewerPart in ways that are not
 * possible through the normal KPart interface.
 *
 * Note that besides the functions below here, KGraphViewer also has
 * some signals you can connect to.  They aren't in this class cause
 * we can't have signals without having a QObject, which
 * KGraphViewerInterface is not. To see a list of signals, take a look at kgraphviewer_part.h
 * 
 * See the example code below for how to connect to these..
 *
 * Use it like this:
 * \code
 *  // fetch the Part..
 *  KLibFactory *factory = KLibLoader::self()->factory("kgraphviewerpart");
 *  if (factory) {
 *      part = factory->create<KParts::ReadOnlyPart>(this);
 *
 *      // cast the part to the KGraphViewerInterface...
 *      KGraphViewerInterface* graph = qobject_cast<KGraphViewerInterface*>( part );
 *      if( ! graph )
 *      {
 *        // This should not happen
 *        return;
 *      }
 *      // now use the interface in all sorts of ways...
 *  }
 * \endcode
