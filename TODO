Current bugs;
  * nodes placement in editor after a few additions

Before 2.0
  * Wait for KDE4.0 release

URGENT (for 2.x)
  * [DONE] port to KDE 4
  * [NO] use the Qanava library ?
  * [NO] integration in kate and konqueror ;
    (so a change in the kate view of the graph would relayout and reload the 
    file). Started through the editor changes
  * [NO] menu to open the file in kate OR to open a katepart inside the kgraphviewer 
    window (see kgrapheditor)
  * loading of big and huge graphes (currently, there is performance problems 
    around 1000 nodes) ;
  * progressive support of more and more dot attributes and values ;
  * [DONE] layout in background (thread to don't block the interface, with progress 
    bar). done with no progress bar
  * define print zone with the mouse
  * add a speed factor (speed vector) to dragging scroll as in ZGRViewer
  * all configuration data stored for each file (zoom, position, page setup, 
    layout program used, ...)
  * more i18n
  * more export options

REALLY NEEDED ?
  * [PARTLY DONE, see kgrapheditor and syanot] graph editing facilities ;
  * [PARTLY DONE, see syanot] non-dot formats supported ;
  * [TO CHECK] saving to dot format (regenerate the initial file or equivalent).
