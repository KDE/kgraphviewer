Current bugs;
* kge: save should not ask to reload due to the change
* If you set the color of an edge, KGraphViewer only changes the color of the arrow instead of the entire edge. I am using the edge attribute: 
 


URGENT (for 2.x)
  * [DONE] should be able to set background color
  * loading of big and huge graphes (currently, there is performance problems
    around 1000 nodes). Will be done through the use of another layout algorithm. Should the be able to switch to graphviz to display part of thhe graph ;
  * progress bar for the layout in background
  * define print zone with the mouse
  * add a speed factor (speed vector) to dragging scroll as in ZGRViewer
  * all configuration data stored for each file (zoom, position, page setup,
    layout program used, ...)
  * more i18n
  * more export options
  * [COMPLETE?] progressive support of more and more dot attributes and values ;
  * [DONE] port to KDE 4
  * [DONE] layout in background (thread to don't block the interface)


  * Is there a way to let kgraphviewer reposition the graph on the
   target (or source) of some edge? (eg, I am looking on node 'a'
   and there is an edge a->b, I want to click on the edge and
   then the graph is repositioned to 'b')
  * Where can I configure the zoom steps? 
  * birdseye view in a separate window?

REALLY NEEDED ?
  * [PARTLY DONE, see kgrapheditor and syanot] graph editing facilities ;
  * [PARTLY DONE, see syanot] non-dot formats supported ;
  * [TO CHECK] saving to dot format (regenerate the initial file or equivalent).
  * [NO] use the Qanava library ?
  * [NO] integration in kate and konqueror ;
    (so a change in the kate view of the graph would relayout and reload the
    file). Started through the editor changes
  * [NO] menu to open the file in kate OR to open a katepart inside the kgraphviewer
    window (see kgrapheditor)
