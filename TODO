KDE4 Porting:
  * WhatsThis pb (kdelibs bug ?)
  * zooming centering (currently places at top left)
  * port printing API
    * remove QT3/KDE3 classes
    * check dialogs

Before 2.0
  * Complete port to KDE4
  * Wait for KDE4.0 release

URGENT (for 2.x)
  * port to KDE 4
  * use the Qanava library ?
  * integration in kate and konqueror ;
    (so a change in the kate view of the graph would relayout and reload the 
    file)
  * menu to open the file in kate OR to open a katepart inside the kgraphviewer 
    window
  * loading of big and huge graphes (currently, there is performance problems 
    around 1000 nodes) ;
  * progressive support of more and more dot attributes and values ;
  * layout in background (thread to don't block the interface, with progress 
    bar)
  * define print zone with the mouse
  * add a speed factor (speed vector) to dragging scroll as in ZGRViewer
  * all configuration data stored for each file (zoom, position, page setup, 
    layout program used, ...)
  * more i18n
  * more export options

REALLY NEEDED ?
  * graph editing facilities ;
  * non-dot formats supported ;
  * saving to dot format (regenerate the initial file or equivalent).
